### About
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the past years, scientific research in Data Science (DS) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) has witnessed vast progress. The number of published papers and digital objects (e.g., data, code, models) is growing exponentially[^1] [^2]. However, not all research artefacts fulfill the criteria of being *findable*, *accessible*, *interoperable* and *reusable* (FAIR)[^3], contributing to a rather low level of reproducibility of experimental findings reported in scholarly publications and to the reproducibility crisis.

The Open Science Best Practices found in this website were collected to encourage the FAIR management and development of digital artefacts in DS and AI. It is worth noting that some of the recommendations should be followed directly in a paper, while the others (e.g., data preprocessing steps) could be addressed in a separate (meta)data/code documentation.

The recommendations are aligned with the typical research timeline associated with the development of scientific articles and split into the four phases:
>1. Before starting the research
>2. During the research
>3. Paper submission
>4. Paper publication
