Are you at the very beginning of your research project?

In this section, you will find recommendations for planing and starting **FAIR**[^1] [^2] [^3] research in Data Science (DS) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Here and in the next phases, we will focus on how to ensure FAIRness of DS and AI digital artifacts such as **(meta)data**, **models**, **code**, **software** and **(research) knowledge graphs (KGs)**. 

The figure below presents the key questions to be addressed before proceeding with any DS and AI project. Those are aimed to serve as a reference when you plan the project and as a checklist before you start the actual research. Note: The questions under (meta)data as well as code/models/software apply to KGs as well. Therefore, to avoid redundancy we did not include a seperate node for KGs in the figure.

## DATA AND METADATA
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Decide whether **pre-existing data** can be used and/or **raw data** should be collected.
2. Define the **goal** for data collection/reuse.
3. Before starting to collect/reuse data, assess whether it is a subject to **privacy/legal/ethical/copyright restriction** (see Sec. Legal/ethical considerations under Submission). 
4. In case of data collection:
* Plan an **approach** and **methods** (how data will be collected, the duration of the data collection, etc.).
* Decide on **metadata**, **ontologies** and the way data **documentation** will be provided.
5. Decide on the data **storage**, **security**, **sharing** (e.g., with collaborators) and **preservation** strategy during and after the project.
6. Assess **resources required**, e.g., computational costs for collecting, storing and pre-processing data, expenses on annotators, etc. 

Consider the following **data search and collection services:**
* Research Knowledge Graphs such as [<span style="color:blue">ORKG</span>](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3360901.3364435) or [<span style="color:blue">OpenAIRE Graph</span>](https://graph.openaire.eu)
* [<span style="color:blue">Papers With Code</span>](https://paperswithcode.com)  
* [<span style="color:blue">Google Dataset Search</span>](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com)
* [<span style="color:blue">Kaggle</span>](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
* [<span style="color:blue">Hugging Face Datasets</span>](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/index)
* [<span style="color:blue">Awesome Public Datasets</span>](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets#agriculture)
* [<span style="color:blue">Data.world</span>](https://data.world/search?context=community&entryTypeLabel=dataset&type=resources)
* [<span style="color:blue">ELG</span>](https://live.european-language-grid.eu)
* Additional useful data collection services are available under *"I want to collect/create data"* and *"I want to reuse data"* on [<span style="color:blue">NFDI4DS</span>](https://www.nfdi4datascience.de/services/) webpage.

## CODE, MODELS AND SOFTWARE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Decide whether **existing code/software/models** can be used. Before using an existing resource, check its **implementation conditions** (e.g., have a look at its licence type). Consider the following code/models/software **search services:**
* [<span style="color:blue">Hugging Face Models</span>](https://huggingface.co/models)
* [<span style="color:blue">SourceForge</span>](https://sourceforge.net)
* [<span style="color:blue">Software Heritage</span>](https://www.softwareheritage.org)
* [<span style="color:blue">ELG</span>](https://live.european-language-grid.eu)
3.  Assess **resources required**, e.g., computational costs for running and storing the code/model/software.
4. Decide on **storage**, **security**, **sharing** (e.g., with collaborators) and **preservation** strategy during and after the project.

## (RESEARCH) KNOWLEDGE GRAPHS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Decide whether **existing** and/or **new** data, code, models, software should be used for KG development.
2. Decide on the **storage**, **security**, **sharing** (e.g., with collaborators) and **preservation** strategy during and after the project.
3. Assess **resources required**, e.g., computational costs for collecting, storing and pre-processing data, expenses on annotators, etc. 

## PUBLICATION VENUE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Find and select the suitable publication venue in advance. 
1. Make sure that your **paper fits the scope** of the venue and that its content is relevant to the venue’s topics.
2. Assess the **credibility** of a journal or publisher:
* Check the **impact factor** of an academic journal, i.e., the yearly average of citations of articles published in the last N years in a given journal. You can search for the journal's impact factor by specifying its full name or International Standard Serial Number (ISSN). Note that this measure should be used to compare the journals from the same field. For instance, Artificial Intelligence journal (AIJ) (impact factor of 14.05 for 2021) vs the Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research (JAIR) (impact factor of 2.441 for 2019). Both are scientific journals on Artificial Intelligence research.
* Check whether articles go through a **peer-review process** and if it is fully disclosed. Check what peer-review type the venue adheres to: **i) Single-blinded**, author(s) do not know the identity of reviewers; **ii) Double-blinded**, both identity of authors and reviewers is anonymised; **iii) Open**, identity of authors and reviewers is known by all participants (during or after the review process); **iv) Transparent**, reviewers’ report, authors’ response and editors’ decision letters are published along with an accepted paper; **v) Collaborative**, either reviewers work together to review a manuscript or they collaborate with authors to improve a paper; **vi) Post-publication**, the review is done after a paper has been published.
* Check whether the **submission guidelines** are clearly stated on the journal/conference webpage.
* Check whether information on **ethical considerations** such as plagiarism, conflicts of interest, informed consent, confidentiality, etc., is provided.
* Check members of the **editorial board**. The committee should consist of well-known experts in the field, affiliated with recognized institutions and hold appropriate academic credentials.
* Check if there are **fees** for publication, this information should be clearly stated.
3. Make sure to pick a publication venue that provides **full Open Access** to the eventual paper:
* Check the **author and copyright policies** of the journal/proceedings of the conference. Ideally, the venue permits authors to retain their copyright, meaning that authors are allowed to reuse, distribute, republish etc. their work.
