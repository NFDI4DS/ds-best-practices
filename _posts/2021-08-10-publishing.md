1. Make sure to address all comments from reviewers. If any additional calculations or model training were performed, ensure that relevant information is updated not only in the paper but also in the documentation for (meta)data, code, models, software, and KGs/RKGs.
2. Ensure that all author details are provided correctly.
3. Carefully check the pre-print version of your paper. Make sure that no mistakes were made by the editors (e.g., equations and references are correct and in the right place).
4. Do not forget to share the revised version with your co-authors.
