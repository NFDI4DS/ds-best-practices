Are you ready to publish your paper?

In this section, you will find a few recommendations for submitting the final version of your paper.

### CAMERA READY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Make sure to **address all comment**s from reviewers. If any additional calculations, training, etc. were performed, ensure that relevant information is updated not only in the paper but also in the documentation for (meta)data, software, model, code.
2. In case of a **double-blinded paper review**, ensure that after revision your paper still does not contain information which reveals your identity (see Journal/conference requirements under Paper submission).
3. Carefully **check the pre-print version** of your paper. Make sure that no mistakes were made by the journal editors (e.g., equations and references are correct and in the right place).
